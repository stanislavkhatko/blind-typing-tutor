   - Add user-friendly error messages

4. **Add Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all classes and methods
   - Create a comprehensive API documentation
   - Document the application architecture

## Development Environment

1. **Update Dependencies**
   - Update webpack and related packages to the latest versions
   - Consider adding Babel for better browser compatibility
   - Add ESLint for code quality enforcement

2. **Improve Build Process**
   - Add source maps for better debugging
   - Implement code splitting for better performance
   - Add minification and optimization for production builds

3. **Add Testing**
   - Implement unit tests with Jest or Mocha
   - Add integration tests for key user flows
   - Set up continuous integration

## Features and Enhancements

1. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
   - Implement high contrast mode

2. **User Experience**
   - Add a tutorial for first-time users
   - Implement user profiles to save progress
   - Add more detailed statistics and progress tracking
   - Implement difficulty levels that adapt to user performance

3. **Additional Languages**
   - Add support for more languages as mentioned in the roadmap
   - Implement language-specific keyboard layouts
   - Add custom vocabulary options

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize rendering performance
   - Implement lazy loading for resources
   - Add offline support with service workers

5. **Mobile Support**
   - Make the application responsive for mobile devices
   - Implement touch-friendly controls

   - Or consider a modern framework like React, Vue, or Svelte

2. **Modernize CSS**
   - Implement CSS variables for theming
   - Use Flexbox and Grid for layouts
   - Consider using a CSS preprocessor like SASS

3. **Refactor Wordline Class**
   - Break down the large Wordline class into smaller, focused components
   - Separate UI logic from business logic

## License and Documentation

1. **Update License**
   - ✅ Change from ISC to MIT license
   - ✅ Add LICENSE file to the repository
   - Update license information in all source files

2. **Improve README**
   - Add more detailed installation instructions
   - Include screenshots and GIFs demonstrating the application
   - Add badges for build status, test coverage, etc.

## Deployment

1. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up automated testing and deployment
   - Add version tagging for releases

2. **Improve Hosting**
   - Consider using a CDN for static assets
   - Implement proper caching strategies

By implementing these recommendations, the Blind Typing Tutor will become more maintainable, feature-rich, and user-friendly.
